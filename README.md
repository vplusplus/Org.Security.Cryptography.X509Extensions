# Org.Security.Cryptography.X509Extensions
`X509Certificate2` Extensions and classes for Encrypting and Signing using X509 certs.

# Getting started

- Clone or download the repo
- Compile Org.Security.Cryptography.X509Extensions.csproj to get the assembly.
- Refer the assembly in your project.

## Usage (Encryption)

 ```C#
     var x509Certificate = GetCertificateUsingYourWay(); // This certificate doesn't need to have private key.
     Stream yourStreamToEncrypt = GetYourStreamToEncrypt();
     var encryptedStream = new MemoryStream();
     x509Certificate.EncryptStream(yourStreamToEncrypt,encryptedStream);  
 ```
    
## Usage (Decryption)
 
 ```C#
     var x509Certificate = GetCertificateWithPrivateKeyUsingYourWay();
     Stream yourStreamToDecrypt = GetYourStreamToDecrypt();
     var decryptedStream = new MemoryStream();
     x509Certificate.DecryptStream(yourStreamToDecrypt, decryptedStream);  
 ```
For other APIs, please refer the unit tests or the [API documentation](https://dotnet-demos.github.io/Org.Security.Cryptography.X509Extensions/api/index.html)

# Documentation

[Documentation site](https://dotnet-demos.github.io/Org.Security.Cryptography.X509Extensions/) has [articles](https://dotnet-demos.github.io/Org.Security.Cryptography.X509Extensions/articles/intro.html) as well as [API documentation](https://dotnet-demos.github.io/Org.Security.Cryptography.X509Extensions/api/index.html).

# Running tests

Use `dotnet test` command or use the "Test Explorer" windows of Visual Studio.

In order to view coverage, use any of the below methods.

## Commandline

Below command has codecoverage threshold 100. It will fail as of now.

`dotnet test "src/UnitTests/UnitTests.csproj" --framework Net5.0 /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover /p:Threshold=100 /p:ThresholdType=line /p:Exclude="[*]X509.EnduranceTest.Shared*"`

It is excluding the shared test library.

## Visual Studio

Use the "Run Coverlet Report" extension as mentioned [here](https://www.code4it.dev/blog/code-coverage-vs-2019-coverlet).
